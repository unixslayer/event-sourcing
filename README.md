Basic implementation of Event Sourcing using [prooph/event-store](https://github.com/prooph/event-store), due to fact that [prooph/event-sourcing](https://github.com/prooph/event-sourcing) is abandoned.

## Installation

You can install this via composer by running `composer require unixslayer/event-sourcing` or adding it as requirement to your composer.json

## Usage

This library was created to use [prooph/event-store](https://github.com/prooph/event-store) so if you are not familiar with it, I suggest go ahead and check.

## Support

I strongly recommend for implementing Event Sourcing by your own. You can accomplish that in a way described [here](https://unixslayer.github.io/how-i-did-my-own-implementation-of-event-sourcing) and [here](https://unixslayer.github.io/implementing-aggregate-repository) or [here](https://github.com/prooph/documentation/blob/master/event-store-client/blueprints.md). 
If for some reason you find this library useful and use it, feel free to file an issue. Also, PR will be awesome.
